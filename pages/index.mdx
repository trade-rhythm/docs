# Getting Started

Trade Rhythm is an algo trading platform that enables investors to easily manage their automated investing strategies without needing an advanced team of software engineers.

To access Trade Rhythm, visit [traderhythm.io](https://www.traderhythm.io) on your browser and sign in.

Here are the basic steps to get up and running with Trade Rhythm:

## 1. Link

Once you've logged into Trade Rythm, the next thing you should do is link your Trade Rhythm "Workspace" to your broker and data providers. You can do this by clicking the "Providers" link in the top navigaton bar and then click the "+ Provider" button.

Currently, we support the following providers (including their paper trading alternatives):

- [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets)
- [Coinbase PRO](https://pro.coinbase.com)
- [Polygon](https://polygon.io)

> We expect this list to continue to grow over time so check back often.

## 2. Research

Now that you've linked your broker and data provider, you can navigate to the "Research" page in the top navbar to use our various tools to gather insights for your latest strategies.

## 3. Create

When you're ready to create your first strategy, you can navigate to the "Strategies" page in the top navbar and click on "+ Create New" button.

When creating a strategy, you can give it a name and description as well as select which programming language you would like to use. We also offer a "No Code" option that allows you to create a strategy with ZERO programming skills.

Currently we support the following programming languages:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- No Code

> We expect this list to continue to grow over time so check back often.

## 4. Backtest

Once you have your strategy written, you can backtest it over various time periods to see how it performs. To run a backtest,
click the "Backtest" tab on the "strategy" page of the strategy you want to backtest.

## 5. Deploy

Once you're confident with your strategy and backtest results, you can deploy your strategy by creating an "Implemenation".

An "Implemenation" is a version of your strategy running with a specific instrument (like a stock or curency). You can create as many implemnations of your strategy as you want.

> We highly recommend running your strategy on a "Paper" or "Simulated" account that uses fake money before you start to use your live broker account.
