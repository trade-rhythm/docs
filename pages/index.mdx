# Getting Started

Trade Rhythm is an algo trading platform that enables investors to easily manage their automated investing strategies without needing an advanced team of software engineers.

To access Trade Rhythm, visit [TradeRhythm.io](https://www.traderhythm.io) on your browser and sign in.

Here are the basic steps to get up and running with Trade Rhythm:


## 0. Create a workspace
A workspace in Trade Rhyhtm is a collection of your strategies and service providers that you can (optionally) invite others to join and collaborate with. Likely all the work you do in Trade Rhythm will be done in a workspace.

## 1. Link your Providers

Once you've logged into Trade Rythm, the next thing you should do is link your Trade Rhythm "workspace" to your broker. You can do this by clicking the "Providers" link in the top navigaton bar and then click the "+ Provider" button.

Currently, we support the following providers (including their paper trading alternatives):

-   [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets)
-   [Coinbase PRO](https://pro.coinbase.com)
-   [Polygon](https://polygon.io)

> **NOTE:** We expect this list to continue to grow over time so check back often.

## 2. Research

Now that you've linked your broker and/or data provider, you can navigate to the "Research" page in the top navbar to use our various tools to gather insights for all your strategies. We embed a version of TradingView's [Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/chart) in our Research page as well as screeners for various markets.

## 3. Create

When you're ready to create your first strategy, you can navigate to the "Strategies" page in the top navbar and click on "+ Create New" button.

When creating a strategy, you may give it a name and description as well as choose which programming language you would like to use. We also offer a "No Code" option that allows you to create a strategy with ZERO programming skills.

Currently we support the following programming languages:

-   JavaScript
-   TypeScript
-   No Code

> **NOTE:** We expect this list to continue to grow over time so check back often.

### No Code

To create a strategy using the "No Code" editor, you simply enter in your "enter" and "exit" conditions using any of our predefined technical indicators as well as (optionally) configure a profit target and stop loss.

### TypeScript / JavaScript

To write your strategy using code, you must implement two event handlers: `"init"` and `"tick"`.

We do not allow arbitrary javascript modules to be loaded but we do provide a standard library of tools that you can use if you wish. It contains many useful tools (like how to access your broker and/or data provider) as well as all of our technical indicators. This standard library can be accessed at `https://traderhythm.io/std/v1/mod.js`;

> **NOTE:** The runtime used to execute this code is **not** Node.js so some Node.js specific items will not work.

#### INIT Event

The "init" event handler is called once per implementation and its primary purpose is to setup any "state", including technical indicators, that might be used during the subsequent "TICK" events.

```js
import {
    storage,
    EMA,
    Cross,
    dataProvider,
    brokerProvider,
    OrderType,
    Side,
    OrderClass,
    TimeInForce,
} from "https://traderhythm.io/std/v1/mod.js";

// called once when implementation is created
addEventListener("init", async () => {
    const fastMA = new EMA(50);
    const slowMA = new EMA(100);
    const crossover = new Cross();
    const crossunder = new Cross();

    const bars = await dataProvider.getBarsBack("1Hour", 100);
    bars.forEach((bar, idx) => {
        slowMA.next(bar.c);
        if (idx > 100 - 50) {
            fastMA.next(bar.c);
            crossover.over(bar.c, fastMA.current);
            crossunder.under(bar.c, fastMA.current);
        }
    });

    storage.merge({
        fastMA,
        slowMA,
        crossover,
        crossunder,
    });
});
```

#### TICK Event

The "tick" event handler is called on every "tick" or time period interval for that specific implemnation. In this event you will likely check if your entry criteria are met and submit an order if so.


```js
import {
    storage,
    EMA,
    Cross,
    dataProvider,
    brokerProvider,
    OrderType,
    Side,
    OrderClass,
    TimeInForce,
} from "https://traderhythm.io/std/v1/mod.js";

// init handler would go here

// called on every tick
addEventListener("tick", async () => {
  const [fastMA, slowMA, crossover, crossunder] = storage.multiGet(["fastMA", "slowMA", "crossover", "crossunder"]);

  const [trade, positions] = await Promise.all([
    dataProvider.getLatestTrade(),
    brokerProvider.getPositions(),
  ]);
  const { p: last } = trade;

  // update data
  fastMA.next(last);
  slowMA.next(last);

  // crosses
  const didCrossOver = crossover.over(last, fastMA.current);
  const didCrossUnder = crossunder.under(last, fastMA.current);

  // short circuit
  if (positions.length) return;
  const quantity = Math.floor(10000 / last);
  // check conditon
  if (didCrossOver && fastMA.current > slowMA.current) {
    // should we enter long?
    await brokerProvider.order({
      qty: quantity,
      orderClass: OrderClass.Bracket,
      side: Side.Buy,
      type: OrderType.Market,
      timeInForce: TimeInForce.DAY,
      takeProfit: { limitPrice: last * 1.05 },
      stopLoss: { stopPrice: last * 0.98 },
    });
  } else if (didCrossUnder && fastMA.current < slowMA.current) {
    // should we enter short?
    await brokerProvider.order({
      qty: quantity,
      orderClass: OrderClass.Bracket,
      side: Side.Buy,
      type: OrderType.Market,
      timeInForce: TimeInForce.DAY,
      takeProfit: { limitPrice: last * 0.95 },
      stopLoss: { stopPrice: last * 1.02 },
    });
  }
});
```

## 4. Backtest

Once you have your strategy written, you can backtest it over various time periods to see how it performs. To run a backtest,
click the "Backtest" tab on the "strategy" page of the strategy you want to backtest and then fill out the backtest parameters.

## 5. Deploy

Once you're confident with your strategy and backtesting results, you can deploy your strategy by creating an "Implemenation".

An "Implemenation" is a version of your strategy running with a specific instrument (like a specific stock or curency). You can create as many implemnations of your strategy as you want.

> **PRO TIP:** We highly recommend running your strategy on a "Paper" or "Simulated" account that uses fake money before you start to use your live broker account.

## 6. Collaborate
If you choose, you may invite other users to your workspace to collaborate on your strategies. Make sure you trust the individuals you invite because they will have the ability to create, edit, and remove strategies from the workspace.
